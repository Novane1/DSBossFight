# DSBossFight
Mini-game created during my course.
The game was developed over 3 months by me and a classmate at the beginning of our C++ classes.

The main goal of this project was to get used to the OpenGL library, and in general, to real-time 3D.
The features implemented were either for fun or for a challenge.

In the end, I am satisfied with the outcome of the project, firstly because the game is playable and the goals were reached, but also because my coding skills improved a lot, and my understanding of OpenGL is very satisfying.

TL;DR: After reviewing my code almost a year later, after more practice and also a 4-month internship, I obviously have some critiques of my code:
Overall, the variables could have been named better.
Despite having many classes, there is a lack of inheritance that could have facilitated the overall comprehension and durability of the code.
It seems a bit long and tedious to add new objects or features to the game right now.
